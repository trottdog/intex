    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Ella Rises empowers young women to pursue higher education through
      multicultural programs rooted in mariachi, ballet folklorico and STEAM.
      Through hands on experiences and Latina mentors, girls build confidence,
      discover new pathways and learn to value their spiritual and cultural
      heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As girls move through the Ella Rises experience, they are encouraged to
      envision themselves in college, in meaningful careers and as leaders in
      their families and communities.

          <p class="text-muted">
            Nadia grew up between the borderlands of Mexico and Southern California,
            the oldest of three daughters in a close, faith centered family. She
            studied Human Development at Brigham Young University and later trained
            in a Mexican culinary institute in Mexico City.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            While living in Mexico City, she reconnected with her heritage in a new
            way and began to see how culture, faith and education could come
            together to lift young women. That vision became Ella Rises. Nadia now
            serves as Creative and Executive Director, guiding the programs and
            experiences that help girls rise with clarity, confidence and purpose.
